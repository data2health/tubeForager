# tubeForager
Web app supporting curation of YouTube videos for inclusion in the CTSAsearch index.

tubeForager manages search results from YouTube relevant to the CTSA consortium. There is support for browsing of channels,
playlists and videos, with the ability to flag each as relevant or non-relevant. Relevant resources are included in CTSAsearch
results. While our harvesting of metadata is currently focused on video relevant to investigators and staff, we anticipate
that resources relevant to patients and research subjects will also be of interest to the consortium at some point.
